# MeshJoin_ETL
This repository contains the implementation of a data warehouse prototype for Metro using the Mesh Join algorithm. The project includes setting up a star schema, loading transaction and master data, and performing data analysis using SQL queries. The Mesh Join algorithm is used to efficiently join and load data in a near-real-time ETL process.
